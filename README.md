# Face Mask And Social Distancing Detection Using VGG19.

## Overview
Face masks help reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by interfering with the spread of virus-laden droplets ejected from the nose and mouth. Wearing face mask is one of the precautionary steps an individual can take in order to lessen the spread of COVID-19. In this Deep Learning model we can identify if the person is wearing a mask or not, also we can detect if they are violating social distancing norms or not.

I have used OpenCV and VGG19 as the model's base, as it gave the best prediction results of about 98.26%.

## Installation

1. Download the code in ZIP or open with GitHub Desktop or git clone ```https://github.com/parthkohli92/Face-Mask-Detection```
2. Install required python dependencies into your python environment / virtual environment using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
3. Run the file for the detection.
